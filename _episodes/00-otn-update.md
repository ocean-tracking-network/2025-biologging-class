## Intro to OTN

The Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) supports global telemetry research by providing training, equipment, and data infrastructure to our large network of partners. 

OTN and affiliated networks provide automated cross-referencing of your detection data with other tags in the system to help resolve "mystery detections" and provide detection data to taggers in other regions. OTN's Data Managers will also extensively quality-control your submitted metadata for errors to ensure the most accurate records possible are stored in the database. OTN's database and Data Portal website are excellent places to archive your datasets for future use and sharing with collaborators. We offer pathways to publish your datasets with OBIS, and via open data portals like ERDDAP, GeoServer etc. The data-product format returned by OTN is directly ingestible by analysis packages such as glatos and resonATe for ease of analysis. OTN offers support for the use of these packages and tools.

Please contact **OTNDC@DAL.CA** if you are interested in connecting with your regional network and learning about their affiliation with OTN.

##  Intended Audience

This set of workshop material is directed at researchers who are ready to begin the work of acoustic telemetry data analysis. The first few lessons will begin with introductory R - no previous coding experince required.

If you'd like to refresh your R coding skills outside of this workshop curriculum, we recommend [Data Analysis and Visualization in R for Ecologists](https://datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/ "Website for R ecology lesson") as a good starting point. Much of this content is included in the first two lessons of this workshop.

##  Getting Started

Please follow the instrucions in the **"Setup"** tab along the top menu to install all required software, packages and data files. If you have questions or are running into errors please reach out to **OTNDC@DAL.CA** for support.

##  Intro to Telemetry Data Analysis

OTN-affiliated telemetry networks all provide researchers with pre-formatted datasets, which are easily ingested into these data analysis tools.

Before diving in to a lot of analysis, it is important to take the time to clean and sort your dataset, taking the pre-formatted files and combining them in different ways, allowing you to analyse the data with different questions in mind.
