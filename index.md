This workshop will introduce the R programming language, popular in the field of biologging.

We will explore some of the popular software packages suitable for exploring and plotting acoustic telemetry data, including `dplyr` and `ggplot2`, for the purpose of generating summaries for reports.

To expand your knowledge, our other curriculums offer a brief overview of other powerful packages like `glatos`, `actel`, `remora`, `pathroutr`, `mgcv`, and `miscYAPS`.
